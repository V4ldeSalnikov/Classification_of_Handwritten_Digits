Classification of Handwritten Digits
Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits using the Keras dataset. Through hands-on experience, the goal is to train a variety of classification algorithms and determine the best one using tools from scikit-learn. This challenging project was completed as part of the JetBrains Academy's curriculum, requiring approximately 33 hours of dedicated work.
Objectives of project
    Data Handling: Load and preprocess the dataset containing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
    Model Training: Explore and train various sklearn classification algorithms.
    Optimization: Tune model parameters to achieve the best classification results.
    Evaluation: Compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective algorithm.

Technologies Used
    Keras: For accessing and utilizing the handwritten digits dataset.
    scikit-learn: Used for training classification models and optimizing their parameters.
